# EulerGuard Configuration File Example
# Copy this file to eulerguard.yaml and customize as needed
# Priority: command-line flags > environment variables > config file > defaults

# Path to compiled eBPF object file
bpf_path: ./bpf/main.bpf.o

# Path to detection rules file
rules_path: ./rules.yaml

# Path to log file
log_file: ./eulerguard.log

# Output events as JSON lines (default: false)
json_output: false

# Performance tuning options
performance:
  # eBPF ring buffer size in bytes (default: 262144 = 256KB)
  # Increase for high-load systems to prevent event loss
  ringbuf_size: 262144
  
  # Process tree maximum age (default: 30m)
  # Processes older than this are removed from memory
  # Format: 30m, 1h, 2h30m, etc.
  proctree_max_age: 30m
  
  # Maximum number of processes to keep in tree (default: 10000)
  # Oldest processes are evicted when this limit is reached
  proctree_max_size: 10000
  
  # Log buffer size in bytes (default: 65536 = 64KB)
  # Larger buffers reduce I/O but use more memory
  log_buffer_size: 65536

# Environment Variables:
# You can also configure EulerGuard using environment variables:
#   EULERGUARD_BPF_PATH=/path/to/main.bpf.o
#   EULERGUARD_RULES_PATH=/path/to/rules.yaml
#   EULERGUARD_LOG_FILE=/var/log/eulerguard.log
#   EULERGUARD_JSON=true
