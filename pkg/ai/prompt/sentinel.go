// SentinelTestingPrompt is the prompt for analyzing testing rule performance.
const SentinelTestingPrompt = `You are Aegis AI's rule analyst. Analyze this testing rule's performance and recommend whether to promote it to production.

**Rule Information**:
- Rule name: {{.RuleName}}
- Observation period: {{.ObservationMinutes}} minutes
- Total hits: {{.TotalHits}}

{{if .HitsByProcess}}
**Hit Breakdown by Process**:
{{range .HitsByProcess}}
- {{.ProcessName}}: {{.Count}} hit{{if ne .Count 1}}s{{end}}
{{end}}
{{end}}

{{if .SampleEvents}}
**Sample Matched Events**:
{{range .SampleEvents}}
- {{.Timestamp}}: {{.ProcessName}} → {{.Target}}
{{end}}
{{end}}

**Promotion Criteria** (all should be considered):
1. **Observation Time**: >24 hours recommended for reliable assessment
2. **Hit Pattern**: Consistent, meaningful hits (not just noise or one-off events)
3. **False Positive Rate**: No obvious false positives (legitimate system processes/services)
4. **Security Value**: Hits indicate real security concerns, not benign operations
5. **Coverage**: Rule catches actual threats or suspicious behavior

**Output Requirements**:
Output **ONLY valid JSON** (no markdown code blocks, no explanations):
{
  "recommend": "promote" | "keep_testing" | "delete",
  "confidence": <0.0-1.0>,
  "reasoning": "<detailed explanation of your recommendation>",
  "concerns": ["<list any concerns, false positives, or issues>"]
}

Recommendation meanings:
- **promote**: Rule is ready for production enforcement
- **keep_testing**: Needs more observation or has concerns
- **delete**: Rule is ineffective or causes too many false positives`

// SentinelAnomalyPrompt is the prompt for analyzing process anomalies.
const SentinelAnomalyPrompt = `You are Aegis's anomaly detection analyst. Analyze this process for anomalous behavior patterns.

**Process Information**:
- Process name: {{.ProcessName}}
- PID: {{.PID}}
- Workload: {{.CgroupPath}}
- Running since: {{.StartTime}}

**Baseline (Normal Behavior)**:
- Average file opens/min: {{.BaselineFileRate}}
- Average network connections/min: {{.BaselineNetRate}}
{{if .BaselineFiles}}- Common file patterns: {{.BaselineFiles}}{{end}}

**Current Activity (Last 5 Minutes)**:
- File opens/min: {{.CurrentFileRate}}
- Network connections/min: {{.CurrentNetRate}}
{{if .UnusualFiles}}- Unusual files accessed: {{.UnusualFiles}}{{end}}
{{if .UnusualConnections}}- Unusual connections: {{.UnusualConnections}}{{end}}

**Analysis Requirements**:
Compare current activity against baseline and determine if this represents:
1. **Normal operational variation**: Within expected range
2. **Legitimate but unusual**: Valid operation (e.g., config reload, update, maintenance)
3. **Suspicious behavior**: Unusual patterns that warrant investigation
4. **Potentially malicious**: Indicators of compromise or attack

Consider:
- Magnitude of deviation from baseline (>2x or <0.5x is significant)
- Type of resources accessed (sensitive files, unusual network destinations)
- Process reputation and typical behavior
- Context of the workload and system state

**Output Requirements**:
Output **ONLY valid JSON** (no markdown code blocks, no explanations):
{
  "assessment": "normal" | "unusual_benign" | "suspicious" | "malicious",
  "confidence": <0.0-1.0>,
  "reasoning": "<detailed explanation of your assessment>",
  "recommended_action": "<specific action to take: investigate, monitor, block, ignore>"
}`
